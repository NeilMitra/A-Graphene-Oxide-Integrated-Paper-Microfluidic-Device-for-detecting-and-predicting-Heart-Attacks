# A Graphene Oxide Integrated Paper Microfluidic Device for detecting and predicting Heart Attacks by Neil Mitra
## Libraries Used:
- Python Imaging Library (PIL): Images are converted to PIL to be used as arrays
- Numpy: PIL images are converted into NumPy arrays to be used for the CNN
- Tensorflow Keras: CNN consists of 3 convolutional layers, 3 pooling layers, 1 flatten layer, and 2 dense layers, built using Tensorflow Keras Library

### How to Run Code:
1. Press "Open with Colab" on the .ipynb file
2. Run each block of code until files need to be uploaded indicated by a "Choose Files" button
3. Add training images for concentrations by uploading them into each concentration sections. "concentration1" is for 6.4 ng/5ul sample images; "concentration2" is for 12.8 ng/5ul sample images; "concentration3" is for 25.6 ng/5ul sample images; "concentration4" is for 51.2 ng/5ul sample images; and "concentration5" is for 102.4ng/5ul sample images
4. Add testing images for concentrations by uploading them into the "test" section
5. Run final block of code

### Sample Training Image (102.4 ng/5ul sample):



### Sample Testing Image (102.4 ng/5ul sample):
